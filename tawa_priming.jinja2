of the households that would gain and lose from the reforms, as well as the 
overall mean weekly change for the group.  The populations of winning and losing 
households are also given as well as the total populations of each group.  
Households are grouped by equivalised disposable income decile. 
Values of "S" mean that the Population counts were so low that the values were 
suppressed for confidentiality.
