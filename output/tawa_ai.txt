You will be asked questions that relate to microsimulation output for several hypothetical
reforms to New Zealand's tax and transfer system in the 2022
tax year. Your role will be to act as a chatbot and reply concisely.

The reform scenarios are described in the following python dictionary:

{'FTC5a42.7k25': 'Increase the Family Tax Credit (FTC) rate for the eldest child by 5 dollars per week, maintain the current abatement threshold at 42,700 dollars, and keep the abatement rate at 25%', 'FTC5a42.7k26': 'Increase FTC rate by 5 dollars per week and increase abatement rate to 26%', 'FTC5a42.7k27': 'Increase FTC rate by 5 dollars per week and increase abatement rate to 27%', 'FTC7.5a42.7k27': 'Increase FTC rate by 7.5 dollars per week and increase abatement rate to 27%', 'FTC7.5a42.7k28': 'Increase FTC rate by 7.5 dollars per week and increase abatement rate to 28%'}


The fiscal cost of each reform is given in the following table:

      Scenario     Value
  FTC5a42.7k25 157755000
  FTC5a42.7k26 111328000
  FTC5a42.7k27  67875000
FTC7.5a42.7k27 145199000
FTC7.5a42.7k28 102888000

In your answers please quote these to the nearest million dollars.


The following tables, one for each reform, describe the mean weekly income change 
of the households that would gain and lose from the reforms, as well as the 
overall mean weekly change for the group.  The populations of winning and losing 
households are also given as well as the total populations of each group.  
Households are grouped by equivalised disposable income decile. 
Values of "S" mean that the Population counts were so low that the values were 
suppressed for confidentiality.

The following table describes the change in the number of children living
in two income based measures of poverty:  The fixed-line after housing costs (AHC50), 
and the moving-line before housing costs (BHC50) poverty measures.

From a value for money perspective, which reform best supports low income households?

-----------------------------------------

The "FTC5a42.7k27" reform provides the best value for money in supporting low-income households. This reform increases the Family Tax Credit (FTC) rate by 5 dollars per week and increases the abatement rate to 27%. It also costs 68 million dollars, considerably less than all other reforms.

For deciles 1 to 3 of equivalised disposable income (the lowest income households), winners from this reform experience weekly income increases of 10, 9, and 8 dollars respectively. Some households (particularly in deciles 3) do lose from this reform, but the mean weekly change for all households in these deciles remains positive. 

Moreover, this reform reduces both fixed-line AHC50 and moving-line BHC50 child poverty measures by 8000 and 5000 children respectively, considering the margins of error. This is a considerable achievement given the lower fiscal cost.

-----------------------------------------

which reform is the most tightly targeted to low incomes?

-----------------------------------------

The "FTC5a42.7k27" reform is the most tightly targeted to low incomes. 

For the first three deciles of equivalised disposable income (the lowest income groups), this reform provides weekly income increases of 10, 9, and 8 dollars respectively. This implies that the most substantial gains are seen by the lower-income households, thereby indicating that this reform is directed tightly at this income group.

However, this reform also results in more losers amongst these initial deciles compared to the other reforms, with households in the third decile losing on average 5 dollars a week. By the fourth decile, the number of households losing from this reform exceeds those gaining and the weekly losses also grow larger, indicating that this reform targets support below this level.

This reform reduces child poverty, measured by the fixed-line AHC50 and moving-line BHC50 definitions, by 8000 and 5000 children respectively, considering the margins of error. Again, this shows the reform is effective in targeting low-income households with children.
